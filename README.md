Project Name: MauronAlpha
Author: contact@mauru.net

This is an attempt at creating a custom modular codebase for C# Projects that is portable between Windows and Linux Environments.

*DISCLAIMER* This is not a stable product. Feel free to contribute but be aware that this is not a static codebase and that any changes you make might get thrown out at any time (so fork away but don't expect me to try and maintain this constantly).


The planned feature set includes:

1. A command line interface

2. A GUI interface

3. A GameEngine Wrapper with support for polygons that can be plugged into other game-Engines easily (monogame, unity, ...)

4. A context-sensitive Text-processor

* Updates *


Currently nothing works. But it once worked. Then I decided to make things better and broke something ;-) Which is good but also time-consuming.

Please consult the File Info.mau for further notes on how things progress. It is relatively unreliable so it might not be quite up to date.
