Project Name: MauronAlpha
Author: contact@mauru.net

This is an attempt at creating a custom modular codebase for C# Projects that is portable between Windows and Linux Environments.

Currently this code is horribly broken and highly unstable but you might find some interesting bits and pieces to reuse in your own projects.

The planned feature set includes:

1. A command line interface

2. A GUI interface

3. A GameEngine with support for polygons that can be plugged into other game-Engines easily (monogame, unity, ...)

4. A context-sensitive Text-processor
